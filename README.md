# Nineveh (WIP)

Nineveh is a library of common gpu-functions and GL related helper functions.

It is intended to act as a sort of standard library for gpu programming.

It currently provides gpu functions for:
- common math operations outside of the glsl spec
- hashing
- noise
- color-space conversion
- interoplation & misc curves
- tonemapping
- graphing
- normal generation

And CPU side functions for:
- primitive mesh generation
- cube-map & hdr texture loading
- cube fbo helpers

Amongst others
